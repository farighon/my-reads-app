This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In our MyReads app, the user can see which books are currently being read, want to
be read, and which have been read. It also allows the user to search for books using
an API provided by Udacity and add a book from the search results to one of the
three sections.

To get started, you'll need to clone this repo, cd into the directory, and run
`npm install` to download all of the dependencies of the project. Once that's been
completed, you'll then have to run `npm run` to start the project in your
local environment.
